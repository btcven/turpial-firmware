## Contributing to Turpial Firmware

Presently most of our contributors use the Spanish language. We are seeking volunteers to translate the [CONTRIBUTING-ES.md](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-ES.md) file to this CONTRIBUTING-EN.md file.

For new contributors who use the English language, until CONTRIBUTING-ES.md has been translated, please consider using a translator app to get familiar with contribution guidelines.
