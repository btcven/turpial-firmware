<h1 align="center">Turpial Firmware</h1>

Welcome, and thank you for your visit. Here you can
find the main firmware for the Turpial device, compatible with Locha Mesh and be aware
of our development process.

## What is Locha Mesh

The Locha Mesh network is a secure radio network for text messaging and Bitcoin
transactions. The main objetive is a long range network for everyone and
everywhere. For this reason we are working not only in a protocol, but also
in the firmware for affordable devices like our **Turpial**.

If you want to learn more about Locha Mesh, feel free to read
[this repository](https://github.com/btcven/locha) or take a look at our website
[locha.io](https://www.locha.io).

## Development workflow

The development code is located on the `dev` branch, all the development
happens there and all of the Pull-Request should be pointed to that branch.
Please make sure your Pull-Request follows the **CONTRIBUITING.md** guidelines.

## Compiling and Flashing

In order to compile the firmware (and to flash it) we use the
[Platform IO IDE](https://platformio.org/), it's available as a
[VS Code Extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) primarily, however,
it can be used as a standalone CLI too without the need to install another
editor, please refer to the Platform IO website to see supported installation
methods.

For example, to build your project you can run this command on a CLI that has
PlatformIO:

```bash
pio run -e featheresp32 --target upload
```

That command will build the project and upload the binary to the ESP32 you have
connected, the `-e featherep32` specifies the board model you have. Currently
the supported boards are:

- `featheresp32`
- `wemosbat`
- `esp32doit-devkit-v1`

If your ESP32 development board isn't listed here you can modify the
`platformio.ini` file and submit a Pull-Request adding the board.

## Running tests

To ensure the safety of the code, we run some tests in the ESP32 to ensure the code
works as expected, the testing code lives in the `test/` directory. To compile
a test you can run the following command:

```bash
pio test -e featheresp23 -f test_wifi
```

Please note that you can change `featheresp32` for the board of your choice,
and you can change `-f test_wifi` to the test you want to run, or you can
remove it to run all tests.

## Compiling documentation

You can compile the code documentation by installing the following tools:

1. [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
2. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. `pip -U install sphinx`
4. `pip -U install breathe`

Now you can just checkout to the `doc/` directory and run:

```bash
make html
```

The documentation will reside in `doc/build/_html/`, from there you can open
`index.html`.
