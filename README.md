<h1 align="center">Turpial Firmware</h1>

We are happy of your visit and that you can read more about us. Here you can
find the main firmware for your device compatible with Locha Mesh and be aware
of our development process.

## What's Locha Mesh?

The Locha Mesh network is a secure radio network for text messaging and bitcoin
transactions. The main objetive is a long range network for everyone and
everywhere, for this reason, we are working not only in a protocol, also the
firmware for affordable devices like our "Turpial".

If you want to learn more about Locha Mesh feel free to read
[the Locha Mesh main repository](https://github.com/btcven/locha) or take a
look at our website [locha.io](https://www.locha.io).

## Sponsor.

If you want to support this project you can make a donation to the Locha Mesh
effort to build a private censorship-resistant mesh network devices for Bitcoin and Lightning Network payments without Internet.

Here are some places if you want to support us:

- Donate: https://locha.io/donate
- Buy Turpial devices: https://locha.io/buy

## Supported boards.

Currently we use the [ESP-WROVER-KIT](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wrover-kit/overview)
development board to test the code and the radio module, althought other ESP32
boards can be used as long as it fits on the flash memory. It should work on
both the WROOM and WROVER chips without changes on the code.

The board connects over UART to the
[SimpleLink CC1312R](https://www.ti.com/product/CC1312R) radio module, the
pinout is yet to be decided in the final complete board design. See the
[radio-firmware](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware) repository for more
information on the radio module we use.

## Getting Started.

Since this is an open source project you can contribute with your code and
knowledge, or by making changes to the documentation. Here's a brief
description on how to work with the code, to compile

### Development workflow

Development happens in the `dev` branch, all of the Pull-Requests should be
pointed to that branch. Make sure you follow the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. All Pull-Requests
require that at least two developers review them first before merging to `dev`
branch.

### Installing ESP-IDF.

To compile the firmware (and to flash it) you need to install the
[ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/) development framework, which
brings the compiler and necessary tools in order to correctly build the
project.

### Compiling.

We use the idf.py command line tool provided by ESP-IDF to build the project,
it's pretty simple to build the project:

```bash
idf.py build
```

### Flashing the firmware.

To upload the binary to the ESP32 you have connected to your computer, you
need to use the following command:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash
```

Where `PORT` specifies on what port you have connected your ESP32 development
board.

### Running tests

To ensure the safety of code we run some tests in the ESP32 to ensure the code
works as expected, the testing code lives in the `test/` directory. To compile
a test you can run the following command:

```bash
cd test/
idf.py build -D "TEST_COMPONENTS=yourcomponent"
```

You can change `yourcomponent` to the test component you want to run tests for.
Don't forget to flash the test binary to run the code. See
[*Flashing the binary.*](#flashing-the-binary).

### Compiling documentation

You can compile the code documentation by installing the following tools:

1. [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
2. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. `pip install -U sphinx`
4. `pip install -U sphinx-rtd-theme`
5. `pip install -U breathe`

Now you can just checkout to the `doc/` directory and run:

```bash
make html
```

The documentation will reside in `doc/build/_html/`, from there you can open
`index.html`.
